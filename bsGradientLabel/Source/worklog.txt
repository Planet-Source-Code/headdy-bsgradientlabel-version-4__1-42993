Amazing how far the bsGradientLabel has come, huh?

Anyways, some wiseguy wanted to highlight the fact that Windows 95 doesn't have msimg32.dll as standard, as an excuse to complain about the code. Fair enough, I should have mentioned that detail as soon as I had found out myself, but if he/she wanted to score brownie points then they have failed.

Bearing this little thing in mind, I decided to update the code to get rid of reliance on msimg32.dll, and hopefully make it more efficient at the same time. I searched PSC and found the clsGradient class, written by Rocky Clark of Kath-Rock Software, which draws gradients (at angles, too) super-fast and is well renowned. The only problem is it only supports PictureBoxes and not device contexts (out of the box anyway, I soon modified it to suit my needs).

This left the problem concerning 4-way gradients. For this, I searched PSC again to save myself a bit of coding. A totally independent solution came from the genius that is known as Rohit Kulshreshtha. Big shout goes out to him/her too.

I wasn't sure if I had a worklog for this control to begin with, so I decided to start one now.

The bsGradientLabel started life as a single-line control, that acted as a Label control but with a gradient background. Over time it has inherited three types of gradient, border styles, text alignment, padding, text orientation and a text shadow.
